Implemented in: [safe/type-size.rkt](https://github.com/ovidiugabriel/buildpro/blob/master/preprocessor/lib/safe/type-size.rkt)

Every type is implemented as a range.
This approach is heavily inspired by Ada constrained types (where a subtype is a type together with an associated constraint)

> Their major purpose, is for greater program reliability: a constraint expresses a logical requirement on our program in an explicit manner, and it therefore opens up the possibility of reporting violations of this logical requirement, should they ever occur. -- "Rationale for the Design of the AdaÂ® Programming Language"

This method is very powerful, yet flexible and allows to do a lot of things in a safe manner,
for example to define separate types for odd and even numbers.

```racket
;; Type for all odd numbers between [1 and 65535]
(define odd_t (type 2 (range 1 65535 2)))

;; Type for all even numbers between [0 and 65534]
(define even_t (type 2 (range 0 65534 2)))
```

#### Limits of integral types

Let's see how we can get the value of `INT_MAX` as a function of `int` type. Using RTTI (`typeid` operator and `type_info` class) is out of question because it does not apply to primitive/fundamental types. It is also not possible to use `decltype` for this purpose.

```cpp
int c;
cout << decltype(c); // error: not possible
```
In this case we have to rely on some macros.

```cpp
#define max_of(x) x ## _MAX
cout << max_of(INT); // works fine

#define max_of(x) x ## _max
#define int_max INT_MAX
cout << max_of(int); // we forced it by declaring a lowercase alias
```

But beyond the traditional preprocessor we have another way where the preprocessor is type aware.


##### `(range-max type)`

Returns the value for `<type>_MAX` by reading the value of `max` member of `range` struct.

##### `(range-min type)`

Returns the value for `<type>_MIN` by reading the value of `min` member of `range` struct.
